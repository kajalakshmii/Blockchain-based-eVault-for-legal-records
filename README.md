**Overview
**    The Blockchain Based E-Vault System is a cutting-edge platform that capitalizes on blockchain technology's decentralized nature, particularly leveraging Ethereum's blockchain. Its primary objective is to provide a secure and decentralized system for uploading, storing, and sharing images. By integrating the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), the project ensures images are stored in a distributed manner, offering immutability and robustness against data tampering.
The core functionality revolves around using Solidity smart contracts within the Ethereum blockchain. These smart contracts facilitate ownership management and access control over the uploaded images. Users can securely upload their images to the IPFS network and specify access permissions through smart contract functionality, allowing or revoking access to specific individuals.
**Features
**Blockchain-Based eVault System:
Our primary objective is to develop a blockchain-based eVault system for legal records.
We leverage established blockchain platforms like Ethereum, Hyperledger, or Corda.
Smart contracts are utilized to manage access, permissions, and transactions, ensuring security and transparency.
User-Friendly Interfaces:
We prioritize user-friendliness with interfaces tailored for lawyers, judges, clients, and registrars.
Users can easily upload, retrieve, and track changes in legal documents.
The platform features document creation and saving options within our app and website.
Virtual Stamp Paper Validation:
Lawyers can generate virtual stamp papers within our platform.
These virtual stamp papers are electronically verified by registrars, eliminating the need for physical stamp papers.
This innovation saves time, reduces costs, and ensures document authenticity.
Room Creation and Sharing:
Users can create dedicated virtual rooms for specific cases.
Within these rooms, users can securely share documents and evidence.
Collaboration is streamlined for clients, lawyers, and judges, enhancing case management and communication.
Privacy and Security:
Stringent privacy measures are in place with advanced encryption and authentication mechanisms.
Access controls are finely tuned to restrict unauthorized access, ensuring the confidentiality of legal records.
Integration with Existing Systems:
Seamless integration is a core feature, allowing our system to work harmoniously with existing legal databases and case management systems.
This ensures interoperability and future adaptability to evolving legal requirements and technological advancements.
